# Speech-Authentica
Welcome to the Speaker Authentica! This application allows you to accurately identify and verify speakers from a self-collected dataset of 100 speakers with remarkable precision.

<b>Introduction</b>

The Speaker Identification and Verification Web Application is built using deep learning techniques like LSTM, LSTM RNN, GRU to accurately identify and verify speakers from a custom dataset. With a focus on precision and robustness, the application offers a user-friendly interface to streamline the process.

<b>Features</b>

<strong>Speaker Identification:</strong> Upload an audio sample, and the application will identify the corresponding speaker from the dataset.

<strong>Speaker Verification:</strong> Determine if the provided audio matches the voice of a specific speaker in the dataset.

<strong>User-Friendly Interface:</strong> An intuitive web interface for easy interaction and navigation.




<strong>Custom Dataset:</strong> Train the model on your own dataset of 100 speakers for domain-specific applications.

Here is the custom dataset which I've collected on my own:
